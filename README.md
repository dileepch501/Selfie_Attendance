# Selfie_Attendance:
Generally we register the attendance of pupil manually which take a lot of time, they can also manipulate in some cases or else we use biometric system which coasts high. So I come up with an android application free of coast using facial recognition, which connects with a particular router of the organization and when you click the selfie attended will be register.
